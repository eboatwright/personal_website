		My name is Evan Boatwright, and I'm a self-taught, home-schooled programmer from central Texas.
		I've programmed in almost every mainstream language, and my favorites are Rust, Python, Svelte and Dart.
		<br><br>
		I got my start in 2016, when I was 9 years old I found the Scratch visual scripting platform, and I was instantly hooked!
		Though after almost a year, I was starting to feel the limits of Scratch. So in early 2017, I picked up the Unity game engine along with C#.
		<br><br>
		Since then, I've used almost every mainstream language, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, Go, Rust, Dart, and many more!
		I also tried out langauges like C, C++, and Haskell, but they just didn't stick with me like the others did.
		<br><br>
		Aside from programming, I've also played music since late 2012, and picked up every instrument I can get my hands on!
		Including ukulele, guitar, bass, mandolin, fiddle, piano, and drums.
